We will parametrize the simulations for N using the codebase used in CCS, but start with 18 colonies, 1-3 times per year
This will give us a table with the true N and the simulated N values

We take the true N and a ratio to get the maximum F for that colony and year (Fg)
With the curvature for Fmax and randomly sampled date or dates, take 1-3 samples of F (Fd)
Then sample from a normal with these Fd values and the SD for the sampling error, to obtain the sampled F value(s).

Then...
If there was only 1 sample for F, then that becomes the estimated F
If there were 2 samples, then take the mean or max
If there were 3 or more, then fit the parabola and get the max
