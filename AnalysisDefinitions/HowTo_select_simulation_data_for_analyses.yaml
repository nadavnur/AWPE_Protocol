## 	The yaml file explains what data to extract from an AWPE simulation set in terms of: 
##   Number of years (5 = years 1 through 5; 2 = years 1 & 4; 3 = years 1, 3, and 5; 6 = all 6 years)
##   Number of sites (1, 4, 10 or 18)
##   Number of surveys to each site per year (1, 2, or 3)
##   Or altering any of the above based on transect definitions
##   Processing file: processSimulations.R  -- this code file extract the data from the simulations file using the parameters in the yaml file

## EXAMPLE
ProjectId: AWPEsurveyDesign		#A name for the project
SimulationName: AWPE_6years1visits2weeks18sites #A code to identify this data simulation definition
DefinitionAuthor: Nadav Nur		#Who created the definition
SimulationsFile: //prbo.org/Data/Home/Petaluma/lsalas/Documents/lsalas/IandMR8/AWPE/simulations/1000sim_1visit.RData	#Name of the data file with the source data to be extracted for the simulation
Transects:        #We simulated only one, but could be extended to more than one transect definition, each definition differing in the values of the following parameters
   -
      TransectId: General 	#Name of the transect
      NumSites: 18  #The number of sites to include in this transect. If fewer than the max in the simulation, the first N (value provided here) will be used. All other transect definitions use the remaining sites if any available
      NumYears: 6 #The number of years to include in the analysis - valid: 2, 3, 5, or 6
      NumVisitsAdultSurveys: 1    #The number of visits to an adults survey site in a year. Valid values: [1, 3], 2. Values 1 or 3 can be used with simulation files where 3 visits were simulated. Value 2 can only be used for files where 2 visits were simulated.
      NumVisitsJuvenileSurveys: 1    #The number of visits to a juveniles survey site in a year. Same restrictions as with adults survey sites.
