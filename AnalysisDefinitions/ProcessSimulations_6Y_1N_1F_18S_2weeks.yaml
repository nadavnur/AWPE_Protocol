## This file explains how to process an AWPE simulation set in terms of: 
##   Number of years (5 = all 5 years; 2 = years 1 & 4; 3 = years 1, 3, and 5)
##   Number of sites (1, 4, 10 or 18)
##   Number of surveys to each site per year (1, 2, or 3)
##   Or altering any of the above based on transect definitions
##   Output: tables with the values of diffR and estR by year, and by site and year
##   Processing file: processSimulations.R

      NumSites: 18  #The number of sites to include in this transect. If fewer than the max in the simulation, the first N (value provided here) will be used. All other transect definitions use the remaining sites if any available
      NumYears: 6 #The number of years to include in the analysis - valid: 2, 3, or 5
      NumVisitsAdultSurveys: 1    #The number of visits to an adults survey site in a year. Valid values: [1, 3], 2. Values 1 or 3 can be used with simulation files where 3 visits were simulated. Value 2 can only be used for files where 2 visits were simulated.
      NumVisitsJuvenileSurveys: 1    #The number of visits to a juveniles survey site in a year. Same restrictions as with adults survey sites.
