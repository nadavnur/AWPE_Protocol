ATTENTION:

We did not use the population mean to subsample area, transect, and then site means. Instead,
we fixed the site means by sampling only once from the population mean and using the same starting site means throughout.
We sampled from a population with mean 5.5, and using SD = 1.25

We used the following sample for 18 sites:
5.394, 4.832, 6.997, 3.774, 7.218, 4.981, 6.949, 6.065, 7.053, 4.96, 5.559, 5.635, 5.903, 6.475, 3.729, 5.079, 4.47, 3.78
These are the stating site means, and they remain constant, since trend is 0.
