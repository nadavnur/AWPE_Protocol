## This file simulates: 
##   Area trend for 1 areas and 18 sites. Abundance (the overarching mean) has some proceess variation - every year this mean goes up or down some small amount.
##   Each site receives a sample from the overall mean (overall distribution of abundances) that varies by year (so, unique mean by site and year) 
##   Each site is surveyed 3 times, with some curvature in abundance over time within the year.
##   There is no imperfect detection, but each survey is made with some error
