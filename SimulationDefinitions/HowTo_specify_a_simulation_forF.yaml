## This file simulates: 
##   Based on a true adult abundance by site and year (N - within each simulation), the file samples a value for F (# fledglings) from provided mean and SD for R. 
##   (R is the ratio of F/N). This sampled value of F for each site is the "true F", and is assumed to be the peak fledgling abundance
##    for the site and yer. Further it varies among dates within the year following a provided curvture.
##   If the curvature is provided and the site is surveyed 3 times/year, 3 values (i.e., the value of F in three different days) are taken for each site.  
##    That is, the true value of F is thus calculated for each site and year, for each of 3 survey dates. The curvature is fittid with a quadratic function  
##    for which the quadrature (parameter "Cseason", always negative), and breeding season start and end dates provided. If only 1 survey is taken each year, then the curvature is not used.
##   To initialize the simulation, each site is assigned its own R value (reproductive success - sampled from mean and SD for R). This random assignment of R values happens
##    only once at the beginning and is kept truoughout the bootstraps so as to force the simulations of each survey location to always start at the same values of F, R and N
##   The stochasticity in the model is generated at the survey site level: a sample is taken from each site (based on its simulated mean and provided sampling error
##    (parameter SigSample) to add survey error to the simulation.
