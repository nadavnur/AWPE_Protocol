FixSiteEffects: FALSE #If TRUE the site R means are set at year 0 and kept, relative to area R, constant throughout the yearspan. If false, then the site R means are sampled every year.

      Cseason: -0.0010944  #The seasonal curvature parameter for survey sites in this population - make 0 for no curvature, otherwise a very small value, usually < 0.001
      SeasonStart: -26 #The first day to define the survey period. Day 0 is where density is at its maximum value in the curvature
